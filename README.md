Software forks for avid ricers.

This organization maintains forks of excellent free and open-source (typically desktop but sometimes CLI) applications that are perfect in every way, except that they lack accessible file-based options for configuration. 
In the quest for the perfect desktop environment on Linux, it is desirable to make apps keyboard-driven as much as poassible and to make them follow a coherent color theme. The apps contained here follow the original
codebase as much as possible, changing only the portions of code related to configuration.

## Goals and Guidelines

All deviations from the original codebases should be well-documented, with example configurations provided. Refer users to the original documentation for everything else. Configuration should follow an established
structured format or language (JSON, TOML, YAML, KDL, LUA) that makes sense for the application in question.

## Donations

No donations will be accepted. This is a community-driven effort and a labor of love. Please donate to the creators of the original apps.
